Hi there! I’m a neurology resident who transitioned into software engineering, with five years of experience in full-stack web development using TypeScript and JavaScript.

I’ve had the opportunity to work with both local and international companies, delivering innovative solutions that make an impact.

Currently, I’m a Rust developer at [Cosdata](https://www.cosdata.io/), where I’m deepening my expertise in low-level backend development.

# Skills:

- Programming Languages (Typescript, Javascript, Rust)
- Web Design & Development (HTML, CSS, SASS, ...)
- Front-End Technologies (ReactJS, Next.js, Tauri, ...)
- Back-End Technologies (Node.js, NestJS, Express.js, Axum.rs, Actix.rs, ...)
- Databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, ...)
- Docker Containerization
- Software Security & Testing
- Git
