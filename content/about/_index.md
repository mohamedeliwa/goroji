I’m a doctor who transitioned into software engineering, with five years of experience in full-stack web development using TypeScript and JavaScript.

I’ve had the opportunity to work with both local and international companies, delivering innovative solutions that make an impact.

Currently, I’m a Rust developer at <a href="https://www.cosdata.io/" target="_blank">Cosdata</a>, where I’m deepening my expertise in low-level software development.
