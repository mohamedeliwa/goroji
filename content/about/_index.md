I’m a doctor who transitioned into software engineering, with five years of experience in full-stack web development using TypeScript, JavaScript, and Rust.

I’ve had the opportunity to work with both local and international companies, delivering  impactful and innovative solutions.

Currently, I’m a Full-Stack developer at <a href="#">Had For Communications & IT</a>, with a focus on backend development.

I also contribute to open-source Rust projects, such as <a href="https://www.cosdata.io/" target="_blank">Cosdata</a>, where I’m advancing my expertise in low-level software development.
